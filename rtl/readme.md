# rtl
Contains SystemVerilog modules and testbenches for:
* WES207_basic - transmit modulator for Microchip AT86RF215 over LVDS
* audio_input - PDM decimator to SPI target.  Decimate 768kHz PDM data and send to Teensy over SPI target interface

These projects were built using Efinix T20B256 EVB.  The code should be portable to most other FPGAs as well.  

See "WES207 Using EFINIX Board for Project.pdf" for information on ordering and setting up the board.
