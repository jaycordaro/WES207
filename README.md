# 802.15.4 Walkie Talkie
Repo for our WES207 project, a Walkie Talkie using 802.15.4 with Opus Codec. The project is componsed of microcontrollers, RF boards, audio DACs and audio ADCs.  
  
<img src="./images/block_diagram.png">
The core of the walkie-talkie is a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. It interfaces with an ADC and DAC to receive and transmit audio data and communicates with an RF board to relay the audio data over-the-air to other walkie-talkies.      
Audio data is encoded using Skypeâ€™s Opus codec. The Opus codec is made for lossy, low data rate use cases such as what is necessary for this project.

### Teensy to audio DAC
The Teensy and audio DAC communicate over an I2S interface.  
The DAC board's pinout is described here: <img src="./images/audio_DAC.png">

Name | Teensy Pin | audio DAC Pin 
--- | --- | --- 
POWER | 5V | 1
GND | GND | 2

BCLK1 | 21 | 6
LRCLK1 | 20 | 7

### PDMBRD to Teensy
PDMBRD connects to Teensy.  Teensy sends PDMCLK to PDMBRD, PDMBRD sends sigma-delta modulated audio on PDAT to Teensy

Name | Teensy Pin | PDMBRD board Pin 
--- | --- | --- 
PDAT | 5   | J6.1
PCLK | 4    | J8.1
GND  |G    | GND_TP

connect USB-micro to J2 to power PDMBRD.  J11 and J12 of PDMBRD should be jumpered.

FPGA: Handles the heavy digital signal processing tasks, modulating and demodulating signals in accordance with the 802.15.4 PHY. The FPGA will also receive audio data from the microphone and format it in order to be sent to the microcontroller. 
### Component Connections:

#### Teensy to FPGA
The Teensy and FPGA communicate over an SPI interface:  
Name | Teensy Pin | FPGA Pin 
--- | --- | --- 
CS | 0 | 27
MISO | 1 | 28
MOSI | 26 | 30

## Quick Start
1. Connect the Microcontroller, RF Front Board, PDM Board, and Audio DAC according to the instructions in the "components" section
2. Copy the contents of the audio folder onto an SD card and insert it into the Teensy
3. Install the Arduino IDE on your PC
4. Install the Teensy plugin for the Arduino IDE: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html
5. Open the audio_transceiver project from the teensy folder in the IDE
6. Connect the Teensy board to the PC using a micro-USB cable
7. Select the Teensy board from the drop down menu at the top of the Aruduino IDE
8. Click the check mark button to flash the project to Teensy
9. Open the serial interface in by going to View > Serial monitor
10. Repeat the previous steps with a second set of components
11. In the serial monitor of one setup, send the "RX" command
12. In the serial monitor of the other setup, send the "TX" command and speak into the microphone connected to the PDM board.
13. After the recorded message is relayed to the other setup, the recorded audio will play automatically
