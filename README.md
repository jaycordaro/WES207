# 802.15.4 Walkie Talkie
Repo for our WES207 project, a Walkie Talkie using 802.15.4 with Opus Codec. The project is componsed of microcontrollers, RF boards, audio DACs and audio ADCs.  
  
<img src="./images/block_diagram.png">
The walkie-talkie will be composed of 3 main subsystems:  
Microcontroller: This system will be responsible for encoding/decoding audio data and implementing the non-physical layer portions of the 802.15.4 standard. The microcontroller will also be responsible for sending received audio to a speaker for output.   
RF front end: Responsible for taking the digitally modulated data generated by the FPGA, converting it into analog and transmitting it at RF. On the other end, it is also responsible for receiving bursts at RF and converting to digital samples to provide to the FPGA.  

Audio data is encoded using Skypeâ€™s Opus codec. The Opus codec is made for lossy, low data rate use cases such as what will be necessary for our project. Encoding and decoding audio data with the codec will be the main processing load of the microcontroller.  

## Demo

## Components
Component | Model 
--- | ---
Microcontroller | Teensy 4.1
RF Front End    | Microchip REB215-XPRO

Also connect a ground between the boards.  

### Teensy to RF board
The Teensy and RF board communicate over an SPI interface.  
The RF board's pinout is described here: http://atmel-studio-doc.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/webhelp/GUID-48EF8A2C-BED0-4DC2-B36A-38E99440A4F8-en-US-1/index.html?GUID-06EB0063-0126-41F7-B6C9-CEAB087F6BAC

BCLK1 | 21 | 6
LRCLK1 | 20 | 7

#### PDMBRD to FPGA
PDMBRD connects to Teensy.  Teensy sends PDMCLK to PDMBRD, PDMBRD sends sigma-delta modulated audio on PDAT to Teensy

Name | Teensy Pin | PDMBRD board Pin 
--- | --- | --- 
PDAT | 5   | J6.1
PCLK | 4    | J8.1
GND  |G    | GND_TP

connect USB-micro to J2 to power PDMBRD.  J11 and J12 of PDMBRD should be jumpered.
