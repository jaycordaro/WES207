# 802.15.4 Walkie Talkie
Repo for our WES207 project, a Walkie Talkie using 802.15.4 with Opus Codec. The project is componsed of microcontrollers, RF boards, audio DACs and audio DACs.  
  
<img src="./images/block_diagram.png">
The walkie-talkie will be composed of 3 main subsystems:  
Microcontroller: This system will be responsible for encoding/decoding audio data and implementing the non-physical layer portions of the 802.15.4 standard. The microcontroller will also be responsible for sending received audio to a speaker for output.  
FPGA: Handles the heavy digital signal processing tasks, modulating and demodulating signals in accordance with the 802.15.4 PHY. The FPGA will also receive audio data from the microphone and format it in order to be sent to the microcontroller.  
RF front end: Responsible for taking the digitally modulated data generated by the FPGA, converting it into analog and transmitting it at RF. On the other end, it is also responsible for receiving bursts at RF and converting to digital samples to provide to the FPGA.  

Audio data is encoded using Skypeâ€™s Opus codec. The Opus codec is made for lossy, low data rate use cases such as what will be necessary for our project. Encoding and decoding audio data with the codec will be the main processing load of the microcontroller.
