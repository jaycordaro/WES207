# Teensy tests
This folder contains component-level tests for microcontroller tasks and external inerfaces.

## Usage:
Each folder contains its own demo to be run in the Aruduino IDE. Most of these tests use the serial interface to issue commands. Simply open Tools > Serial Monitor in the Aruduino IDE while the Teensy board is selected and enter commands into the text box at the top of the serial monitor.
